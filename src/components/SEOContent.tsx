      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">What is SIP?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        SIP, or Systematic Investment Plan, is a disciplined investment method where individuals invest a fixed amount regularly—usually monthly—into mutual funds. It offers the benefit of rupee cost averaging and compounding, making it ideal for long-term wealth creation.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">What is Step-up SIP?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Step-up SIP, also known as top-up SIP, allows investors to increase their SIP contribution annually by a fixed percentage or amount. This strategy aligns investment growth with rising income levels, accelerating wealth accumulation over time.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">What is Step-up SIP Calculator?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A Step-up SIP Calculator is an online tool designed to help investors estimate the future value of their SIPs when they increase their investment amount annually. It factors in the annual step-up percentage, expected rate of return, and investment duration to give you an accurate picture of potential growth.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">How does Step-up SIP Calculator work?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The calculator uses the power of compounding and annual increments to show how your investments grow year-on-year. You just need to enter:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Initial monthly investment</li>
        <li>Annual step-up percentage</li>
        <li>Expected rate of return</li>
        <li>Investment tenure in years</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        It then calculates:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Total invested amount</li>
        <li>Estimated returns</li>
        <li>Future value with and without step-up</li>
        <li>Difference in returns due to step-up</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">How to calculate returns from Step-up SIP?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To calculate step-up SIP returns manually, you apply the formula:
      </p>
      <div className="bg-[#302478] p-4 rounded-lg mb-4 font-mono">
        FV = P × [{`{(1 + r/n)^(nt) – 1}`} / (r/n)] + S × [{`{(1 + r/n)^(nt) – 1}`} / (r/n)]
      </div>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Where:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>P = Monthly SIP amount</li>
        <li>r = Annual rate of return</li>
        <li>n = Compounding frequency (usually 12)</li>
        <li>t = Time in years</li>
        <li>S = Annual increase in SIP amount</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        However, using an online calculator simplifies the process and gives quicker results.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">Factors Influencing Step-up SIP</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A Step-up SIP can significantly accelerate your wealth-building journey, but its effectiveness depends on multiple factors:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">1. Annual Step-up Percentage</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The annual increase in your SIP amount plays a crucial role in determining how much wealth you accumulate. A higher step-up rate (e.g., 10%–15% annually) leads to a compounding effect on returns. However, it should be aligned with your income growth and affordability to remain sustainable.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">2. Investment Tenure</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The longer your investment horizon, the greater the compounding effect. A step-up SIP held over 10–15 years can deliver significantly higher returns compared to a short-term SIP due to the power of time and increasing contributions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">3. Market Volatility</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Since SIPs typically invest in mutual funds—often in equities—market volatility can affect returns. While market dips might lower returns in the short term, they also offer an opportunity to purchase more units at lower prices, enhancing long-term gains through rupee cost averaging.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">4. Fund Performance</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The performance of the selected mutual fund is critical. Funds with consistent track records and well-managed portfolios tend to deliver better long-term returns. Always consider fund category (equity, debt, hybrid), past performance, and fund manager experience.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">5. Frequency of Compounding</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Mutual fund returns are compounded, typically on a daily or monthly basis. Higher compounding frequency can amplify returns over time, especially when paired with increasing SIP contributions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">6. Starting SIP Amount</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Your initial SIP amount lays the foundation. A higher starting value, even with modest step-up increments, can lead to exponential returns compared to starting small and stepping up aggressively later. Starting early with even a modest amount can also make a big difference.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">Things to Consider Before Starting Step-up SIP Investment</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Planning a step-up SIP requires foresight and strategic thinking. Here are some key factors to evaluate before getting started:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">1. Evaluate Your Income Growth Projections</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Only commit to an annual SIP increase if you foresee consistent income growth. Choose a realistic step-up percentage (typically 5%–15%) to avoid straining your budget in the future.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">2. Set Clear Financial Goals</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Define your investment objective—whether it's retirement planning, child's education, or wealth accumulation. This clarity helps determine the right SIP amount, duration, and expected returns.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">3. Choose the Right Mutual Fund</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Different funds carry different levels of risk and return. Equity funds are suited for long-term growth, while debt funds offer stability. Select funds that align with your risk appetite and financial goals.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">4. Consider Inflation Impact</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Inflation reduces purchasing power over time. Step-up SIPs help you counter this by gradually increasing investment amounts. Ensure your step-up rate outpaces or at least matches inflation.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">5. Use a Step-up SIP Calculator for Planning</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Before you begin, use a reliable online step-up SIP calculator to simulate various scenarios. Compare results with and without step-ups to see how much extra wealth you can generate.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">6. Consistency and Discipline Matter</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Avoid withdrawing or skipping SIPs mid-way. Discipline in investing, especially with step-ups, is key to unlocking long-term benefits.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">7. Review and Reassess Annually</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Revisit your SIP plan every year. Adjust the step-up percentage based on your latest income, expenses, and life changes. You can even pause step-ups temporarily if needed.
      </p>
